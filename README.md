## Frontend Development and Deployment Report

### 1. Overview

The frontend of the application is developed for both web and mobile platforms to provide a responsive and high-performance user experience. This section details the technology stack, development practices, hosting, and deployment strategies.

### 2. Web Frontend Development

#### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework:**  
  - *React* is recommended due to its component-based architecture, robust ecosystem, and strong community support.  
  - Alternatively, *Angular* can be used for a more opinionated structure.
- **State Management:** Redux or Context API (with React Query for server state)
- **Routing:** React Router (for React) or Angular Router (for Angular)
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS (Styled Components, Emotion) or utility frameworks like Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tools:** Webpack or Vite
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library (or Karma/Protractor for Angular)

#### 2.2 Development Practices
- **Component-Driven Development:** Create reusable UI components.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilize modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) and media queries.
- **PWA Capabilities:** Implement offline support, service workers, and home screen installation.

### 3. Mobile Frontend Development

#### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Frameworks:**  
  - *React Native* is recommended for shared JavaScript/TypeScript code between web and mobile.
  - Alternatively, *Flutter* can be used for a natively compiled solution.
- **Navigation:** React Navigation (React Native) or Flutter Navigator (Flutter)
- **State Management:** Redux, Context API, or MobX (for React Native)
- **Styling:** Styled Components (React Native) or Flutterâ€™s widget system
- **Testing:** Detox for end-to-end testing, along with Jest and platform-specific unit tests

#### 3.2 Development Practices
- **Code Sharing:** Reuse business logic and data models between web and mobile.
- **User Experience:** Adhere to platform-specific design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS).

### 4. Hosting and Deployment

#### 4.1 Static Content Hosting
- **Object Storage & CDN:**  
  - Use AWS S3 (with CloudFront), Google Cloud Storage (with Cloud CDN), or Azure Blob Storage (with Azure CDN) for hosting static assets.

#### 4.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automation Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins for building, testing, and deploying.
- **Containerization:** Use Docker for SSR or dynamic web applications deployed on Kubernetes.

#### 4.3 High Availability and Resilience
- **CDN Distribution:** Global asset delivery to handle traffic spikes.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrate with AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus, or Grafana.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling for both frontend and backend APIs.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Utilize blue/green or canary deployments, regular backups, and multi-zone deployments.

### 5. Integration with Backend APIs

- **Communication:** Use RESTful endpoints via the API Gateway.
- **Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication (JWT) integrated with Identity Management (Keycloak/Auth0).
- **Error Handling:** Implement retry strategies and exponential backoff for API calls.
- **Data Synchronization:** Use Axios/Fetch API for HTTP requests and React Query for caching.

## Backend API Development and Deployment Report

### 1. Overview

The backend comprises multiple microservices, exposed via a central API Gateway, that manage core functionalities such as parking session management, payments, notifications, user and role management, and auditing. This section details the architecture, technology stack, database management, deployment, and security measures.

### 2. Technology Stack and Architecture

#### 2.1 Languages and Frameworks
- **Languages:**  
  - *Java (Spring Boot)* for enterprise-grade applications.
  - *Node.js (NestJS)* for a modular, scalable solution using TypeScript.
- **Frameworks:**  
  - *Spring Boot* for robust RESTful API development and integration.
  - *NestJS* for a dependency-injected, modular structure.

#### 2.2 API Gateway
- **Options:** Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Routing client requests.
  - Enforcing security policies (token validation, rate limiting).
  - Centralized logging and monitoring.

#### 2.3 Microservices Overview
- **Parking Session Management:**  
  - Handles creation, tracking, and termination of parking sessions.
  - Uses SQL databases for persistence and Redis for caching.
- **Payments Service:**  
  - Integrates with external providers (e.g., MercadoPago) for transactions.
- **Notifications Service:**  
  - Sends alerts via SMS, email, or push notifications using asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka).
- **User and Role Management:**  
  - Manages user authentication and authorization, integrated with IAM.
- **Audit and Logging Service:**  
  - Captures system events for security compliance and troubleshooting.

### 3. Database and Data Management

#### 3.1 Database Systems
- **Relational Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL for core data (users, transactions, sessions).
- **Caching Layer:** Redis for session data, tokens, and high-frequency queries.

#### 3.2 Data Access Patterns
- **ORM/ODM:**  
  - Hibernate with Spring Boot or TypeORM with NestJS.
- **Connection Pooling & Caching:**  
  - Optimize database access with pooling and caching strategies.

### 4. Deployment and Infrastructure

#### 4.1 Containerization and Orchestration
- **Containers:** Docker for packaging microservices.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (managed services like AWS EKS, GKE, or Azure AKS).
- **Serverless:** AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for event-driven tasks.

#### 4.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins.
- **Deployment Strategies:** Blue/Green or Canary deployments.
- **Container Registries:** Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or Google Container Registry.

#### 4.3 High Availability and Resilience
- **Load Balancing:** Use Kubernetes Ingress controllers and API Gateways.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Horizontal pod auto-scaling based on metrics.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Regular backups and multi-zone deployments.

### 5. Security Considerations

#### 5.1 API Security
- **Authentication/Authorization:** JWT with OAuth2/OpenID Connect via IAM.
- **Encryption:** Use HTTPS/TLS for data in transit; encrypt data at rest.
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting and throttling.

#### 5.2 Infrastructure Security
- **Network:** VPCs, security groups, and firewalls.
- **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
- **Audit Logging:** Continuously monitor system activities.

### 6. Integration with External Systems

#### 6.1 Payment Providers
- **Secure RESTful Integration:** HTTPS with error handling and retries.

#### 6.2 Billing and Invoicing
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Use webhooks or message queues.

#### 6.3 Third-Party Authentication
- **IAM Integration:** Seamless integration with Keycloak/Auth0 using OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

### 7. API Design and Documentation

#### 7.1 API Design
- **RESTful Principles:** Stateless, cacheable, uniform interface.
- **Versioning:** Maintain backward compatibility.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error responses.

#### 7.2 Documentation
- **Tools:** Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive documentation.
- **Developer Portal:** Provide comprehensive API documentation and SDKs.
